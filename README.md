# Sudokosolver

This was just a fun little project to challenge myself. There is no real usecase for this project.\
To use it open https://sudoku.com/de/killer (try to make the page as big as possible)\
then run Main.java. It will take a screenshot of the gamefield, solve it and then put the solution into your browser using the keyboard.

For reading the gamefield I used ```tesseract``` and for solving the mathematical equations/constraints of the sudoku I used ```Choco Solver```
